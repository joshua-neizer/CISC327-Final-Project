# How did the team organize the documentation of the test cases?
In summary, a branch, `specifications`, was created to store all the test cases before they were finalized and merged into `master`. This would be done in a team meeting where everyone could review the test cases all together. Specific branches for each group member, corresponding to their assigned specifications, were created that branched off of `specifications`. For example, Nicole was assigned R6, R7, and R8 to complete test cases for. As can be seen on GitHub, Nicole created a branch `R678_specifications`. In these specification specific branches, each member was able to push their own test cases. From there, they could open a pull request to merge with `specifications`, where it would be reviewed and approved by other members individually.

# What was our understanding of how the chosen testing framework to test the front end? When and how will it be running directly on GitHub?

# How will we organize different test case code files? 
We will make a folder for each requirement in the `/specs` folder. We will also structure our process the same way we organized the test case documentation.
