| Test Name | Test Purpose | Output Incorrectness | Error Source | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **test_r2_2**  | Validates that registration page will show if user isn't logged in | Could not find `register` id  | **register.html**  |  Added `register` id to form in `register.html` |
| **test_r2_4** | Validates registration can be submitted as a POST request | Login page did not contain success message when registration fulfilled POST request| **register_post()** in `frontend.py` on line 70 | Used the flash method from the flask library to pass a message to login.html then redirected, rather than rendering login.html with the message and not redirecting |
| **test_r2_5_neg_email** | Validates that all emails submitted have the correct format | Test failed because html did not allow empty field to be submitted so no error message was passed to the page from `frontend.py` | `register.html` | Removed required attribute in input fields |
| **test_r2_5_neg_password2** | Validates that all password2s submitted have the correct format | No test associated | **register_post()** in `frontend.py` on lines 54 to 56 | Used the same format for the password format check, but passed password2 as the argument |
| **test_r2_9** | Ensures that for any formatting error, the user is redirected to the login page with the error message | The user was not redirected to the login page | **register_post()** in `frontend.py` on line 46 |  Changed the redirect page to be the login page along with flashing the message to /login |
| **test_r2_10** | Checks to see if the user already exists | Was treated as a formatting error | **register_post** in `frontend.py` on line 66  | Adjusted the error handling so that it is independent from the formatting errors by rendering `register.html` with the message instead of redirecting to /login  |
